Think about the tech in your life. Your phone, full of messages and photos; your computer, a perfectly balanced chaos of work and entertainment; your game console, with half-played games maxing out the internal storage. Your tech is well-used, and that’s a good thing. Now, delete it. Nuke your hard drives. Reset all of your tech to factory settings. Embrace the erase.No, I haven’t lost my mind. I’m not advocating for burning up your digital photos, or erasing all of your treasured conversations. I’m not saying you need to delete your data for good, I’m saying your need to restore your devices to how they were when you bought them. If that sounds contradictory, allow me to elaborate.
