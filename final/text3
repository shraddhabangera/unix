No, I haven’t lost my mind. I’m not advocating for burning up your digital photos, or erasing all of your treasured conversations. I’m not saying you need to delete your data for good, I’m saying your need to restore your devices to how they were when you bought them. If that sounds contradictory, allow me to elaborate and are helpull for future.
